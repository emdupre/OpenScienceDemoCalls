**New! Open Science demo calls**

The OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group (OSSIG) invites you to participate in monthly Open Science Demo Calls!  These calls allow you to hear from the developers of open neuroimaging tools as well as discuss resources you may use (or want to use) but don't know much about. These calls are a great chance to find out about tools and initiatives (both old and new) you may not have heard of yet.

You can explore questions such as "Why did a developer make a tool and make it openly available?"; "What was their process for creating it?"; "How do they see it being used?",  "How do they hope it will grow in the future?" and "How can you get involved?"

The open neuroimaging community is great and growing every day. We will use these calls to build connections between all members of the OHBM Open Science community and to tell the stories of the people making outstanding and reproducible neuroscience happen.

**MARK YOUR CALENDAR** FOR Thursday 1st February 2018, 7pm GMT and participate in the Open Science Demo Call.

The first call will feature Guilomar Niso on [MEG-BIDS](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/08/172684), Alejandro de la Vega on [NeuroScout](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/neuroscout), and Cameron Craddock on [Brainhack Global 2018](http://www.brainhack.org/).

The Open Science Demo Calls will be livestreamed on YouTube from the [OHBM OpenScience Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ), and all recordings will be archived on the channel and on the OHBM blog for easy access.
